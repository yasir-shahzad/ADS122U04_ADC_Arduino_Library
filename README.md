# ADS122U04 ADC Arduino Library

The TI ADS122U04 is a precision 24-bit delta-sigma analog to digital converter. It can measure voltage very
accurately through two differential or four single-ended inputs. It has a flexible input multiplexer,
a low-noise programmable gain amplifier, two programmable current sources, a voltage reference
and an in-built precision temperature sensor. In summary, it contains everything you need for a wide
variety of applications including being able to measure temperature accurately from remote sensors.
